Are you shining for me?

whom you are shining for?

It can't be me.

As the saying going,

"coins with value are coins."

whom you are shining for?

it can be anyone,

it can be anyone.

I've not belonged to "one" for a long time,

By the time you were born,

By the time the world were born,

By the time …… I was born.



Stars,

You're surely not shining for me.

you're shining 

for valuable humans

for him

for her

for you

for anyone.



I don't receive your light,

I'm not anyone,

I'm just a coin,

a poor coin

……

a not well-known coin
